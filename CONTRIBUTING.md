# Contributing

We would love to see people collaborate with me on this project of making the most advanced cryptocurrency trading bot on the planet. If you'd like to help out, you can always submit pull requests. Or if you'd like to see new features, you can always feel free to do so through Github's issues.

## Pre-commit

We leverage the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.

Install git hooks with `pre-commit install` or run the checks manually `pre-commit run`. Passing `-a` to run over all files.
